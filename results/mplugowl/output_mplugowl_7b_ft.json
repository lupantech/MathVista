    "question": "When a spring does work on an object, we cannot find the work by simply multiplying the spring force by the object's displacement. The reason is that there is no one value for the force-it changes. However, we can split the displacement up into an infinite number of tiny parts and then approximate the force in each as being constant. Integration sums the work done in all those parts. Here we use the generic result of the integration.\r\n\r\nIn Figure, a cumin canister of mass $m=0.40 \\mathrm{~kg}$ slides across a horizontal frictionless counter with speed $v=0.50 \\mathrm{~m} / \\mathrm{s}$. It then runs into and compresses a spring of spring constant $k=750 \\mathrm{~N} / \\mathrm{m}$. When the canister is momentarily stopped by the spring, by what distance $d$ is the spring compressed?",

Since \u2220AMN = 140\u00b0, we know that \u2220D = 140\u00b0 and \u2220AMN + \u2220NAC = 140\u00b0 + 90\u00b0 = 230\u00b0.

The codec groups every 4 barks into a subband and then allocates bits to different subbands according to the result of a spectrum analysis based on a psychoacoustic model. All samples in the same subband are quantized with the same quantizer, and the bit resolution of which is allocated by the codec. (The Bark scale is a psychoacoustical scale proposed by Eberhard Zwicker in 1961.) Fig. Q1a shows the frequency spectrum of a windowed segment of audio signal. The psychoacoustic model shown in Fig. Q1b is used in the audio codec to derive the masking threshold for the audio segment. How many potential maskers in Fig. Q1a?",

    "response": "A: The midpoints of the legs of a trapezoid are called the bases. In this case, the bases are R and S. Therefore, the midpoint of the leg connecting points R and S is the midpoint of the trapezoid itself, which is point A. Since we have already found the midpoint of the leg connecting points T and S, which is point B, we can determine the value of $m \\angle S$ by finding the angle bisector between $A$ and $B$ (midpoint of legs RS and TS).\n\nSince both points A and B lie on the same side of the angle bisector of $\\angle S$, they are called corresponding angles, and the angle bisector between them is called the common angle bisector of $A$ and $B$.\n\nThe common angle bisector of $A$ and B is a line that bisects the angle between A and B, which is $\\angle A_2B_3$. Since $\\angle A_2B_3 = \\frac{\\pi}{4}$, the common angle bisector of $A$ and B is the line that passes through point B and bisects the angle between points $A$ and $(A+B) \\frac{\\pi}{2}$.\n\nIn other words, the common angle bisector of $A$ and B is the line that passes through point B and bisects the angle $A_3B_2$. Since $A_3$ and $B_2$ are both on the same side of the line through B, the common angle bisector of $A$ and B lies on the line connecting points $A_3$ and $B_2$.\n\nNow, we can determine the value of $m \\angle S$ by finding the point on the common angle bisector that is equidistant from points A and B. This point is the midpoint of the line connecting points $A_3$ and $B_2$, which is point M.\n\nTherefore, we can conclude that $m \\angle S = \\angle M_2B_3$ is the angle bisector of $A_3$ and B.\n\nSince the angle bisector of $A_3$ and B is $\\frac{\\pi}{2}$ radians, we can substitute $\\frac{\\pi}{2}$ for $m \\angle S$ to get the correct option: B",

Use the figure to estimate the tangential components of $\\mathbf{a}$.",
    "response": "The magnitude of the acceleration vector $\\mathbf{a}$ is 10 cm/s2, which can be calculated by multiplying the magnitude of the acceleration vector by the distance traveled by the object over the time interval (15 seconds in this case).\n\nSince the acceleration vector is given as the slope of a line in the figure, the tangential component of $\\mathbf{a}$ is the slope of the line. The slope of the line can be calculated by dividing the vertical change by the horizontal change. In this case, the vertical change is the distance traveled (2 cm) and the horizontal change is the displacement of the object from the origin (15 cm). Therefore, the tangential component of $\\mathbf{a}$ is:\n\n$\\mathbf{a}_{T} = \\dfrac{d}{dx} \\mathbf{v}(t) = \\dfrac{-2 \\times 15}{15} cm \\cdot \\dfrac{-10 \\times 10 \\mathrm{~cm} / \\mathrm{s}^2}{2 \\times 10^{-2} \\mathrm{~cm} / \\mathrm{s}^2} = \\boxed{10 \\times 10^{-3} \\mathrm{~cm}/ \\mathrm{s}^2}$",
