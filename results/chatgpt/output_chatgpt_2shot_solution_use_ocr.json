        "response": "To find the distance $d$ by which the spring is compressed, we can use the principle of conservation of mechanical energy.\n\nThe initial kinetic energy of the canister is equal to the potential energy stored in the compressed spring.\n\nThe initial kinetic energy of the canister is given by:\n\n$KE_{\\text{initial}} = \\frac{1}{2}mv^2$\n\nwhere $m$ is the mass of the canister and $v$ is its speed.\n\nThe potential energy stored in the compressed spring is given by:\n\n$PE_{\\text{spring}} = \\frac{1}{2}kx^2$\n\nwhere $k$ is the spring constant and $x$ is the distance by which the spring is compressed.\n\nSince the canister is momentarily stopped by the spring, its final kinetic energy is zero.\n\nTherefore, we can equate the initial kinetic energy to the potential energy stored in the spring:\n\n$\\frac{1}{2}mv^2 = \\frac{1}{2}kx^2$\n\nSimplifying the equation, we have:\n\n$x^2 = \\frac{mv^2}{k}$\n\n$x = \\sqrt{\\frac{mv^2}{k}}$\n\nSubstituting the given values:\n\n$x = \\sqrt{\\frac{(0.40 \\mathrm{~kg})(0.50 \\mathrm{~m/s})^2}{750 \\mathrm{~N/m}}}$\n\n$x = \\sqrt{\\frac{0.10 \\mathrm{~kg \\cdot m^2/s^2}}{750 \\mathrm{~N/m}}}$\n\n$x = \\sqrt{0.000133 \\mathrm{~m^2}}$\n\n$x = 0.011 \\mathrm{~m}$\n\nTherefore, the spring is compressed by approximately 0.011 meters.",

        "response": "Since D is the midpoint of AC, we can use the midpoint formula to find the coordinates of point D. \n\nThe midpoint formula is: \nMidpoint = ( (x1 + x2)/2 , (y1 + y2)/2 )\n\nLet's assume that point A is (x1, y1) and point C is (x2, y2). \n\nSince D is the midpoint of AC, we can set up the following equations: \n(x1 + x2)/2 = x-coordinate of D\n(y1 + y2)/2 = y-coordinate of D\n\nIn this case, we are given that CB = 4.0 and DB = 7.0. \n\nSince D is the midpoint of AC, we can set up the following equations: \n(x1 + x2)/2 = 4.0\n(y1 + y2)/2 = 7.0\n\nSimplifying these equations, we get: \nx1 + x2 = 8.0\ny1 + y2 = 14.0\n\nNow, we need to find the length of AC. We can use the distance formula to find the length of AC. \n\nThe distance formula is: \nDistance = sqrt( (x2 - x1)^2 + (y2 - y1)^2 )\n\nIn this case, the coordinates of point A are (x1, y1) and the coordinates of point C are (x2, y2). \n\nUsing the given information, we can set up the following equation: \nDistance = sqrt( (x2 - x1)^2 + (y2 - y1)^2 )\n\nSubstituting the values we found earlier, we get: \nDistance = sqrt( (8.0 - 0)^2 + (14.0 - 0)^2 )\nDistance = sqrt( 8.0^2 + 14.0^2 )\nDistance = sqrt( 64.0 + 196.0 )\nDistance = sqrt( 260.0 )\nDistance = 16.124\n\nTherefore, the length of AC is approximately 16.124 cm.\n\nThe correct option is not provided in the question.",

        "response": "To find the measure of angle C, we can use the property that the measure of an angle formed by two chords intersecting inside a circle is equal to half the sum of the measures of the intercepted arcs.\n\nIn this case, angle C is formed by chords AB and CD, and it intercepts arc AD. So, we need to find the measure of arc AD.\n\nSince angle D is given as 35\u00b0, angle AED (which is the vertical angle to angle D) is also 35\u00b0. And since angle AEC is given as 105\u00b0, angle AED + angle AEC = 35\u00b0 + 105\u00b0 = 140\u00b0.\n\nThe measure of arc AD is equal to twice the measure of angle AED, so arc AD = 2 * 35\u00b0 = 70\u00b0.\n\nNow, we can find the measure of angle C by using the property mentioned earlier. Angle C = (1/2) * measure of arc AD = (1/2) * 70\u00b0 = 35\u00b0.\n\nTherefore, the correct option is (D) 35\u00b0.",

        "response": "Let's use the law of reflection to solve this problem. According to the law of reflection, the angle of incidence is equal to the angle of reflection.\n\nSince AC is perpendicular to CD, angle CAD is a right angle. Therefore, angle EAD is also a right angle.\n\nLet's call the angle of incidence (angle EAC) as \u03b1. Since the angle of incidence is equal to the angle of reflection, angle EDA is also \u03b1.\n\nNow, we can use the properties of right triangles to find the length of ED.\n\nIn triangle EAD, we have:\ntan(\u03b1) = AD / AE\n\nIn triangle ECD, we have:\ntan(\u03b1) = CD / ED\n\nSince AD = CD - BD and AE = AC - CE, we can substitute these values into the equation above:\n\ntan(\u03b1) = (CD - BD) / (AC - CE)\n\nPlugging in the given values:\ntan(\u03b1) = (10 - 6) / (3 - CE)\n\nSimplifying:\ntan(\u03b1) = 4 / (3 - CE)\n\nNow, let's consider triangle CDE. We have:\ntan(\u03b1) = DE / CE\n\nPlugging in the equation for tan(\u03b1) from above:\n4 / (3 - CE) = DE / CE\n\nCross-multiplying:\n4CE = DE(3 - CE)\n\nExpanding:\n4CE = 3DE - DE^2\n\nRearranging:\nDE^2 - 3DE + 4CE = 0\n\nNow, let's use the fact that CE = CD - DE:\nDE^2 - 3DE + 4(CD - DE) = 0\n\nExpanding:\nDE^2 - 3DE + 4CD - 4DE = 0\n\nCombining like terms:\nDE^2 - 7DE + 4CD = 0\n\nNow, let's substitute the given values:\nDE^2 - 7DE + 4(10) = 0\n\nSimplifying:\nDE^2 - 7DE + 40 = 0\n\nNow, we can solve this quadratic equation using the quadratic formula:\nDE = (-(-7) \u00b1 \u221a((-7)^2 - 4(1)(40))) / (2(1))\n\nSimplifying:\nDE = (7 \u00b1 \u221a(49 - 160)) / 2\nDE = (7 \u00b1 \u221a(-111)) / 2\n\nSince the square root of a negative number is not a real number, there are no real solutions to this equation. Therefore, the length of the line segment ED is not determinable from the given information.\n\nAnswer: Not determinable (N/A)",

        "response": "To find the magnitude of the electric field at radial distance $r=2.00 R_2$, we can use Gauss's Law. Gauss's Law states that the electric field through a closed surface is equal to the total charge enclosed divided by the permittivity of free space.\n\nFirst, let's find the total charge enclosed by the cylindrical shell. The charge on the shell is $Q_2=-2.00 Q_1$. Since the shell is thin-walled, the charge is uniformly distributed on the outer surface of the shell. Therefore, the total charge enclosed by the shell is $Q_{\\text{enclosed}} = Q_2 = -2.00 Q_1$.\n\nNext, let's find the electric field at radial distance $r=2.00 R_2$. Since the rod is inside the shell, the electric field inside the shell is zero. Therefore, the electric field at radial distance $r=2.00 R_2$ is equal to the electric field due to the rod.\n\nThe electric field due to a uniformly charged rod at a point on its axis is given by the equation:\n\n$E = \\frac{kQ}{r^2}$\n\nwhere $k$ is the electrostatic constant, $Q$ is the charge on the rod, and $r$ is the distance from the center of the rod.\n\nIn this case, $Q = Q_1 = +3.40 \\times 10^{-12} \\mathrm{C}$ and $r = R_1 = 1.30 \\mathrm{~mm} = 0.0013 \\mathrm{~m}$.\n\nSubstituting these values into the equation, we can find the electric field due to the rod at radial distance $r=2.00 R_2$.\n\n$E = \\frac{(9 \\times 10^9 \\mathrm{~N \\cdot m^2/C^2})(3.40 \\times 10^{-12} \\mathrm{~C})}{(0.0013 \\mathrm{~m})^2}$\n\n$E = 1.34 \\times 10^6 \\mathrm{~N/C}$\n\nTherefore, the magnitude of the electric field at radial distance $r=2.00 R_2$ is $1.34 \\times 10^6 \\mathrm{~N/C}$.",

        "response": "To solve this problem, we can use the conservation of angular momentum. The angular momentum of the spaceship in its circular orbit is given by:\n\nL = mvr\n\nwhere m is the mass of the spaceship, v is its velocity, and r is the radius of the orbit.\n\nSince the spaceship is in a circular orbit, its velocity can be calculated using the formula:\n\nv = 2\u03c0r / T0\n\nwhere T0 is the period of the circular orbit.\n\nSubstituting this expression for v into the equation for angular momentum, we have:\n\nL = m(2\u03c0r / T0) * r\n\nNow, when the thruster is fired, the speed of the spaceship decreases to 96% of the original speed. This means the new velocity v' is given by:\n\nv' = 0.96v\n\nSubstituting the expression for v into this equation, we have:\n\nv' = 0.96 * (2\u03c0r / T0)\n\nTo find the new period T of the resulting elliptical orbit, we can use Kepler's third law, which states that the square of the period of an orbit is proportional to the cube of its semi-major axis. In this case, the semi-major axis of the elliptical orbit is equal to the radius of the circular orbit.\n\nTherefore, we have:\n\nT^2 / T0^2 = r^3 / a^3\n\nSince r = a, we can simplify this equation to:\n\nT^2 / T0^2 = 1\n\nTaking the square root of both sides, we have:\n\nT / T0 = 1\n\nTherefore, the period of the resulting elliptical orbit is equal to the period of the original circular orbit, which is T0.\n\nThe period T of the resulting elliptical orbit is 7.119 x 10^3 s.",

        "response": "To find the magnitude of the average force on the driver during the collision, we can use the impulse-momentum principle.\n\nThe impulse experienced by an object is equal to the change in momentum of the object. Mathematically, impulse is given by the equation:\n\nImpulse = Change in momentum\n\nThe change in momentum can be calculated using the equation:\n\nChange in momentum = Final momentum - Initial momentum\n\nThe initial momentum of the driver can be calculated using the equation:\n\nInitial momentum = mass * initial velocity\n\nThe final momentum of the driver can be calculated using the equation:\n\nFinal momentum = mass * final velocity\n\nThe average force experienced by the driver during the collision can be calculated using the equation:\n\nAverage force = Impulse / Time\n\nLet's calculate the values step by step:\n\n1. Calculate the initial momentum:\nInitial momentum = mass * initial velocity\nInitial momentum = 80 kg * 70 m/s\n\n2. Calculate the final momentum:\nFinal momentum = mass * final velocity\nFinal momentum = 80 kg * 50 m/s\n\n3. Calculate the change in momentum:\nChange in momentum = Final momentum - Initial momentum\n\n4. Calculate the impulse:\nImpulse = Change in momentum\n\n5. Calculate the average force:\nAverage force = Impulse / Time\nAverage force = Impulse / 14 ms\n\nNow, let's calculate the values:\n\n1. Calculate the initial momentum:\nInitial momentum = 80 kg * 70 m/s = 5600 kg*m/s\n\n2. Calculate the final momentum:\nFinal momentum = 80 kg * 50 m/s = 4000 kg*m/s\n\n3. Calculate the change in momentum:\nChange in momentum = Final momentum - Initial momentum\nChange in momentum = 4000 kg*m/s - 5600 kg*m/s = -1600 kg*m/s\n\n4. Calculate the impulse:\nImpulse = Change in momentum = -1600 kg*m/s\n\n5. Calculate the average force:\nAverage force = Impulse / Time\nAverage force = -1600 kg*m/s / 14 ms\n\nNow, let's convert the time to seconds:\n14 ms = 14 * 10^-3 s\n\nAverage force = -1600 kg*m/s / (14 * 10^-3 s)\n\nFinally, let's calculate the average force:\n\nAverage force = -1600 kg*m/s / (14 * 10^-3 s) = -114285.71 N\n\nThe magnitude of the average force on the driver during the collision is approximately 114285.71 N.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 114285.71.",

        "response": "We are given that angle A is congruent to angle BED and angle C is congruent to angle D. This means that triangle ABC is similar to triangle BED.\n\nSince the ratio of the length of AB to the length of EB is 5:1, we can say that the ratio of the areas of triangle ABC to triangle BED is also 5:1 (since area is proportional to the square of the side lengths).\n\nTherefore, the area of triangle ABC is 5 times the area of triangle BED.\n\nGiven that the area of triangle BED is 5*a^2 + 10, the area of triangle ABC is:\n\n5 * (5*a^2 + 10) = 25*a^2 + 50\n\nTherefore, the correct option is (B) 25*a^2 + 50.",

        "response": "To set up the initial value problem, we need to use the equation for the rate of change of salt in the tank. \n\nThe rate of change of salt in the tank is given by the difference between the rate at which salt enters the tank and the rate at which salt leaves the tank. \n\nThe rate at which salt enters the tank is $\\frac{1}{4} \\mathrm{lb/gal} \\times r \\mathrm{gal/min}$. \n\nThe rate at which salt leaves the tank is $\\frac{Q(t)}{100 \\mathrm{gal}} \\times r \\mathrm{gal/min}$. \n\nTherefore, the initial value problem is:\n\n$\\frac{dQ}{dt} = \\frac{1}{4} \\mathrm{lb/gal} \\times r \\mathrm{gal/min} - \\frac{Q(t)}{100 \\mathrm{gal}} \\times r \\mathrm{gal/min}$\n\nTo find the amount of salt $Q(t)$ in the tank at any time, we need to solve this differential equation. \n\nTo find the limiting amount $Q_L$ that is present after a very long time, we set $\\frac{dQ}{dt} = 0$ and solve for $Q(t)$. \n\nSetting $\\frac{dQ}{dt} = 0$, we have:\n\n$\\frac{1}{4} \\mathrm{lb/gal} \\times r \\mathrm{gal/min} - \\frac{Q_L}{100 \\mathrm{gal}} \\times r \\mathrm{gal/min} = 0$\n\nSimplifying, we find:\n\n$\\frac{1}{4} \\mathrm{lb/gal} \\times r \\mathrm{gal/min} = \\frac{Q_L}{100 \\mathrm{gal}} \\times r \\mathrm{gal/min}$\n\nCancelling out the units and solving for $Q_L$, we get:\n\n$Q_L = \\frac{1}{4} \\times 100 = 25 \\mathrm{lb}$\n\nGiven that $Q_0 = 2Q_L$, we have:\n\n$Q_0 = 2 \\times 25 = 50 \\mathrm{lb}$\n\nTo find the time $T$ after which the salt level is within $2\\%$ of $Q_L$, we need to solve the initial value problem for $Q(t)$ and then find the time at which $Q(t)$ is within $2\\%$ of $Q_L$.\n\nSolving the initial value problem, we have:\n\n$\\frac{dQ}{dt} = \\frac{1}{4} \\mathrm{lb/gal} \\times 3 \\mathrm{gal/min} - \\frac{Q(t)}{100 \\mathrm{gal}} \\times 3 \\mathrm{gal/min}$\n\nSeparating variables and integrating, we get:\n\n$\\int \\frac{1}{4} \\mathrm{lb/gal} - \\frac{Q(t)}{100 \\mathrm{gal}} \\, dt = \\int 3 \\, dt$\n\nSimplifying, we have:\n\n$\\frac{1}{4}t - \\frac{1}{100} \\int Q(t) \\, dt = 3t + C$\n\nTo find the constant of integration $C$, we use the initial condition $Q(0) = Q_0$. \n\nSubstituting $t = 0$ and $Q(t) = Q_0$, we get:\n\n$\\frac{1}{4} \\times 0 - \\frac{1}{100} \\int Q_0 \\, dt = 3 \\times 0 + C$\n\nSimplifying, we find:\n\n$C = -\\frac{Q_0}{100}$\n\nSubstituting this value of $C$ back into the equation, we have:\n\n$\\frac{1}{4}t - \\frac{1}{100} \\int Q(t) \\, dt = 3t - \\frac{Q_0}{100}$\n\nTo find the time $T$ after which the salt level is within $2\\%$ of $Q_L$, we need to solve the equation:\n\n$Q(t) = Q_L - 0.02Q_L$\n\nSubstituting $Q_L = 25 \\mathrm{lb}$, we have:\n\n$Q(t) = 25 - 0.02 \\times 25 = 24.5 \\mathrm{lb}$\n\nSubstituting this value of $Q(t)$ into the equation, we get:\n\n$\\frac{1}{4}t - \\frac{1}{100} \\int 24.5 \\, dt = 3t - \\frac{50}{100}$\n\nSimplifying, we have:\n\n$\\frac{1}{4}t - \\frac{24.5}{100}t = 3t - \\frac{1}{2}$\n\nCombining like terms, we get:\n\n$\\",

Since 7% is greater than 4.5%, we have found a year where the percentage of stunted female children is greater than the average.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 1 year.",

        "response": "To find the distance between B and island M, we need to use the concept of vector addition.\n\nFirst, we need to find the distance traveled by the ship from A to B. The ship travels at a speed of 40.0 nautical miles per hour for 30.0 minutes, which is equal to 0.5 hours.\n\nDistance = Speed x Time\nDistance = 40.0 nautical miles/hour x 0.5 hours\nDistance = 20.0 nautical miles\n\nNext, we need to find the distance between B and island M. The direction of island M is given as 45.0 north by east and 15.0 north by east. We can break this down into its north and east components.\n\nNorth component = 45.0 sin(15.0) = 45.0 x 0.2588 = 11.655\nEast component = 45.0 cos(15.0) = 45.0 x 0.9659 = 43.4675\n\nUsing the Pythagorean theorem, we can find the distance between B and island M.\n\nDistance = \u221a(North component^2 + East component^2)\nDistance = \u221a(11.655^2 + 43.4675^2)\nDistance \u2248 \u221a(135.576 + 1890.001)\nDistance \u2248 \u221a2025.577\nDistance \u2248 45.03 nautical miles\n\nTherefore, the distance between B and island M is approximately 45.03 nautical miles.\n\nThe correct option is (D) 20\u6d77\u91cc.",

        "response": "Since P is the center of the larger circle and Q is the center of the smaller circle, the line connecting P and Q is the line that passes through the centers of both circles. This line is also the line that passes through the points P, Q, and R.\n\nSince P, Q, and R lie on the same line, the radius of the larger circle is equal to the distance between P and Q plus the distance between Q and R.\n\nLet's assume that the radius of the smaller circle is r. Then, the radius of the larger circle is 4.\n\nSince P is the center of the larger circle, the distance between P and Q is 4 - r.\n\nSince Q is the center of the smaller circle, the distance between Q and R is r.\n\nTherefore, the radius of the larger circle is (4 - r) + r = 4.\n\nSimplifying the equation, we get:\n\n4 - r + r = 4\n4 = 4\n\nThis equation is always true, regardless of the value of r.\n\nTherefore, the radius of the smaller circle can be any value.\n\nThe correct answer is (E)",

        "response": "To find the length of the dam bottom AD, we can use the Pythagorean theorem.\n\nLet's label the points as follows:\nA - bottom left corner of the dam\nB - top left corner of the dam\nC - top right corner of the dam\nD - bottom right corner of the dam\n\nWe know that the width of crest BC is 6.0 and the height of the dam is 14.0.\n\nSince the slope of the slope CD is 1.0:2.0, we can determine the length of CD using the ratio of the sides. Let's say the length of CD is x. Then the length of DC is 2x.\n\nUsing the Pythagorean theorem, we can set up the following equation:\n(2x)^2 + (x+6)^2 = 14^2\n\nSimplifying the equation:\n4x^2 + x^2 + 12x + 36 = 196\n5x^2 + 12x - 160 = 0\n\nWe can solve this quadratic equation using factoring or the quadratic formula.

Since the only force acting on the man during the flight is gravity, the vertical component of the velocity at landing will be the same as the vertical component at launch (Vy).\n\nTherefore, the magnitude of the velocity at landing is also 9.67 m/s.",

        "response": "To determine the number of years, we need to compare the earnings from national visitors to the average earnings from national visitors over all years.\n\nFirst, we need to calculate the average earnings from national visitors. We can do this by summing up the earnings from national visitors for each year and dividing it by the total number of years.\n\nFrom the image, we can see that the earnings from national visitors for each year are as follows:\n- Year 2008: $0.00\n- Year 2009: $0.00\n- Year 2010: $0.00\n- Year 2011: $0.00\n- Year 2012: $2.00\n- Year 2013: $8.00\n\nTo calculate the average earnings from national visitors, we add up the earnings and divide by the total number of years:\n(0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 2 + 8) / 6 = $1.67 (rounded to two decimal places)\n\nNow, we need to find the year when the earnings from national visitors exceed the average earnings. From the image, we can see that the earnings from national visitors for each year are as follows:\n- Year 2008: $0.00\n- Year 2009: $0.00\n- Year 2010: $0.00\n- Year 2011: $0.00\n- Year 2012: $2.00\n- Year 2013: $8.00\n\nWe can see that the earnings from national visitors exceed the average earnings in the year 2012.\n\nTherefore, it takes 4 years for the amount earned from national visitors to be greater than the average amount earned from national visitors taken over all years.",
